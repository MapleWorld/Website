			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>
				Hi Bros, <br></br>
				Little information about myself, I am a computer science student at UofT, and I just started learning photography this year (2013). <br/><br/>
				
				I built this website simply for fun and boredom. If you are looking for someone to capture your special moment/event or need to get head shots done, 
				<Span style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold;">FIND SOMEONE ELSE!</Span><br/><br/>
				
				I don't want to ruin your moment/event/your face. <br/><br/>
				
				This is my first website, and I know there are lots bugs and speed/efficiency problem. I will try to fix them when I have time, meanwhile, stick with it.

				Don't brother try sending email through this page, I never check this email anyway.
